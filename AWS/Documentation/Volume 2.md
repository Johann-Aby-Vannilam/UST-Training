## Chapter 1 — Amazon VPC

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is one of the most important AWS services because it forms the networking foundation of cloud infrastructure.

Almost every AWS architecture depends on VPC concepts such as:

IP addressing
subnetting
routing
internet access
private networking
security isolation

1. What is a VPC
Definition

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated virtual network inside AWS where cloud resources are deployed.

A VPC allows organizations to:

control networking
isolate infrastructure
configure routing
define IP ranges
manage internet access
secure workloads
Simple Explanation

A VPC is similar to creating a private data center inside AWS.

Inside the VPC, organizations can create:

subnets
servers
route tables
gateways
security configurations

while maintaining isolation from other AWS customers.

Real-World Analogy

Imagine an apartment complex.

AWS is the entire city.

Your VPC is:

your private apartment building

Inside the building, you decide:

room layout
security
access control
internal organization

Similarly, a VPC gives customers full control over their cloud network.

2. Why VPC is Required
Problem Without VPC

If all cloud resources existed in a shared public network:

security risks increase
traffic isolation becomes difficult
internal communication becomes exposed
enterprise segmentation becomes impossible
VPC Solves These Problems

VPC provides:

network isolation
secure communication
traffic control
subnet segmentation
customizable routing
enterprise-grade networking
Enterprise Benefits of VPC
Benefit	Explanation
Isolation	Separate workloads securely
Security	Control inbound/outbound traffic
Scalability	Support large architectures
Flexibility	Custom network design
Availability	Multi-AZ deployments
Hybrid Connectivity	Connect on-premise infrastructure
Real-World Enterprise Example

A banking application may separate:

public web servers
backend services
databases

into different subnets for:

security
compliance
traffic isolation

This is achieved using VPC architecture.

Why a Custom VPC Was Used in This Project

AWS provides a default VPC automatically.

However, enterprise architectures rarely use default VPCs because they require:

custom subnet layouts
custom routing
private networking
controlled internet access
security segmentation

Therefore, a custom VPC was created.

Practical Implementation in This Project

The project implemented:

Feature	Purpose
Custom CIDR	Scalable IP planning
Public Subnets	Internet-facing services
Private App Subnets	Backend isolation
Private DB Subnets	Database security
NAT Gateway	Secure outbound access
Bastion Host	Controlled SSH access
3. VPC CIDR Planning
What is CIDR Planning

CIDR planning defines how IP ranges are allocated inside a VPC.

Example:

10.0.0.0/16

CIDR planning is extremely important because poor planning can:

limit scalability
create IP conflicts
complicate subnet expansion
break enterprise networking
CIDR Used in This Project

The VPC used:

10.0.0.0/16
Why /16 Was Chosen

A /16 CIDR provides:

65,536 IP addresses
large expansion capability
support for multiple subnet tiers
future scalability
CIDR Breakdown
CIDR	Number of IPs
/16	65,536
/24	256
/32	1
Enterprise CIDR Planning Principles

Good CIDR planning should support:

future growth
subnet expansion
multiple environments
multi-tier design
disaster recovery
Example Enterprise Layout

Private-Subnet-2	10.0.4.0/24
DB-Subnet-1	10.0.5.0/24
DB-Subnet-2	10.0.6.0/24
Why Multiple Subnets Were Used

Multiple subnets improve:

availability
security
traffic isolation
fault tolerance

Each layer was separated logically.

routing complexity
operational issues

Well-designed VPCs improve:

maintainability
scalability
security
reliability

## Chapter 2 — Subnet Architecture

Subnet architecture is one of the most important parts of AWS networking and enterprise cloud infrastructure design.

Subnets determine:

how resources are organized
how traffic flows
which resources are publicly accessible
which resources remain private
how security boundaries are enforced

A properly designed subnet architecture improves:

security
scalability
fault isolation
availability
traffic management

1. What is a Subnet
Definition

A subnet is a smaller logical network created inside a VPC.

Subnets divide a VPC into multiple isolated network sections.

Real-World Analogy

Imagine a large office building.

The building represents:

VPC

Different floors inside the building represent:

Subnets

Each floor can serve a different purpose:

reception
engineering
management
secure storage

Similarly, AWS subnets separate workloads logically.

Why Subnets Are Important

Subnets help:

organize infrastructure
isolate workloads
improve security
manage routing
separate public and private resources

2. Public Subnets
What is a Public Subnet

A Public Subnet is a subnet that has a route to the Internet Gateway (IGW).

Resources inside public subnets can:

access the internet
receive inbound internet traffic
Public Subnet Flow
Internet
↓
Internet Gateway

Why Public Subnets Are Required

Some resources must be accessible from the internet.

Examples:

Load Balancers
Bastion Hosts
Web servers

Resources Placed in Public Subnets in This Project
Resource	Purpose
Public ALB	Internet-facing traffic distribution
Bastion Host	Secure SSH administration
Web Tier	Frontend communication
Public Subnet CIDRs Used
Subnet	CIDR	AZ
Public-Subnet-1	10.0.1.0/24	us-east-1a
Public-Subnet-2	10.0.2.0/24	us-east-1b
Public Route Table Example
0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway

This means:

internet traffic is routed through the IGW.
Enterprise Considerations for Public Subnets

Public subnets should contain only resources requiring internet exposure.

Sensitive resources should NEVER be directly exposed publicly.

Common Beginner Mistake

IMPORTANT:
Beginners often place databases inside public subnets.

This creates major security risks.

Databases should remain private unless absolutely necessary.

3. Private Subnets
What is a Private Subnet

A Private Subnet does NOT have direct internet access through an Internet Gateway.

Resources inside private subnets:

cannot receive direct internet traffic
remain isolated from public access
Why Private Subnets Are Important

Private subnets improve:

security
workload isolation
internal communication protection

Most enterprise backend systems operate inside private subnets.

Private App Subnets Used in This Project
Subnet	CIDR	AZ
Private-Subnet-1	10.0.3.0/24	us-east-1a
Private-Subnet-2	10.0.4.0/24	us-east-1b
Why Backend Servers Were Kept Private

The application tier handled:

API processing
backend logic
database communication

These services should not be publicly exposed.

Instead:

traffic passed through Internal ALB
SG chaining controlled communication
Enterprise Security Benefits

Private subnets reduce:

attack surface
unauthorized access
direct exposure

This is a standard enterprise security practice.

NAT Gateway Usage

Private instances still required internet access for:

package installation
updates
dependency downloads

Therefore:

NAT Gateway was implemented.

4. Database Subnets
What is a Database Subnet

Database subnets are isolated private subnets dedicated to database workloads.

These subnets provide:

additional security
workload isolation
controlled access
Why Database Isolation Is Important

Databases contain:

application data
credentials
sensitive information

Direct public access creates severe security risks.

Database Design Used

The project used:

MySQL hosted on EC2

instead of:

Amazon RDS

This helped provide deeper understanding of:

database installation
Linux administration
MySQL networking
DB security configuration
Why Only Private Access Was Allowed

Database access was restricted to:

application tier
Bastion Host (administrative access)

using:

Security Groups
private routing
Enterprise Database Security Principles

Databases should:

remain private
avoid direct internet exposure
allow restricted access only
use layered security
Common Beginner Mistakes
Mistake	Risk
Public DB exposure	Security breach
Wide-open SG rules	Unauthorized access
Shared subnet usage	Poor isolation

6. Multi-AZ Subnet Design
What is Multi-AZ Design

Multi-AZ architecture distributes infrastructure across multiple Availability Zones.

This improves:

availability
redundancy
fault tolerance
Why Multi-AZ Is Important

If one AZ fails:

resources in another AZ continue operating

This minimizes downtime.

# Chapter 3 — Route Tables & Routing

Routing is one of the most important concepts in cloud networking and AWS infrastructure design.

Routing determines:

where network traffic should go
how systems communicate
which resources can access the internet
how private communication works
how traffic isolation is enforced

In AWS, routing is primarily controlled using:

Route Tables
Internet Gateway
NAT Gateway
local VPC routing

1. What is Routing
Definition

Routing is the process of directing network traffic from one destination to another.

Routing determines:

where packets should travel
which gateway should handle traffic
how networks communicate
Real-World Analogy

Routing is similar to road navigation.

Example:

Home Address
↓
Road Network
↓
Destination

In networking:

Source Server
↓
Route Table
↓
Gateway
↓

Why Routing Is Important

Without routing:

systems cannot communicate
internet access fails
subnet communication breaks
enterprise networking becomes impossible

Routing enables:

internet connectivity
private communication
traffic segmentation
secure infrastructure design

2. Route Tables
What is a Route Table

A Route Table is a collection of routing rules that determines where network traffic should be directed.

Every subnet in AWS is associated with a Route Table.

Simple Explanation

A Route Table acts like:

a traffic control map

It tells AWS:

where packets should go
which gateway to use
how traffic should leave the subnet
Route Table Components
Component	Purpose
Destination	Target network
Target	Gateway or route destination
Example Route Table Entry
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
Target: Internet Gateway

Meaning:

all internet traffic goes through IGW
Local Route

Every VPC automatically includes a local route.

Example:

10.0.0.0/16 → local

This allows:

internal VPC communication
Route Tables Used in This Project
Route Table	Purpose
Public Route Table	Internet access
Private Route Table	NAT routing

│
├── Public RT
├── Private RT
└── DB RT
Why Multiple Route Tables Were Used

Separate route tables improve:

security
traffic isolation
subnet segmentation
enterprise traffic management
3. Static Routing
What is Static Routing

Static routing means manually defining traffic routes.

AWS Route Tables primarily use static routing.

Example
0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway

This route is manually configured.

Advantages of Static Routing
Advantage	Explanation
Predictable	Fixed traffic behavior
Simple	Easy to configure
Controlled	Explicit traffic flow
Secure	Better traffic isolation
Static Routing in This Project

The project manually configured:

internet routes
NAT routes
subnet associations
isolated DB routing
Enterprise Use of Static Routing

Static routing is commonly used in:

VPC architectures
segmented cloud networks
secure enterprise environments

because:

traffic paths remain predictable
4. Default Routes
What is a Default Route

A default route handles traffic when no more specific route exists.

In AWS:

0.0.0.0/0

represents:

all IPv4 internet traffic
Example
0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway

Meaning:

all unknown traffic goes to the internet
Why Default Routes Are Important

Without default routes:

internet communication fails
outbound traffic cannot leave subnets
Default Route in Public Route Table
0.0.0.0/0 → IGW

Used for:

public internet access
Default Route in Private Route Table
0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway

Used for:

secure outbound internet access
Difference Between Public and Private Default Routing
Route	Purpose
IGW Route	Direct internet access
NAT Route	Outbound-only internet access
5. Internet Routing
What is Internet Routing

Internet routing enables AWS resources to communicate with the public internet.

This requires:

IMPORTANT:
Adding an Internet Gateway alone does NOT make a subnet public.

The subnet also requires:

public IP assignment
6. Private Routing
What is Private Routing

Private routing allows internal communication while preventing direct public internet exposure.

Private subnets:

do not route directly to IGW

Instead:

outbound traffic goes through NAT Gateway
Why Private Routing Is Important

Private routing protects:

backend servers
databases
internal APIs

from direct internet access.

## Chapter 4 — Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway

Internet connectivity is one of the most important aspects of AWS networking architecture.

Some AWS resources require:

public internet access
inbound internet communication
outbound internet communication

At the same time, enterprise architectures must also ensure:

backend isolation
secure private networking
controlled internet exposure

AWS provides:

Internet Gateway (IGW)
NAT Gateway

to manage secure internet communication.

Why Internet Connectivity Matters

Modern cloud infrastructure requires internet communication for:

web hosting
software updates
package downloads
API communication
public applications

However, not all resources should be directly exposed publicly.

Enterprise architectures therefore separate:

public internet access
private outbound access

using:

Internet Gateway
NAT Gateway

1. Internet Gateway (IGW)
What is an Internet Gateway

An Internet Gateway (IGW) is a VPC component that allows communication between:

AWS resources
the public internet

It enables:

inbound internet traffic
outbound internet traffic
Simple Explanation

An Internet Gateway acts as:

the main entry and exit point between AWS infrastructure and the internet.
Real-World Analogy

Imagine a secured office building.

The Internet Gateway acts as:

the main gate connecting the building to the outside world.

Without the gate:

people cannot enter or leave.

Similarly:

AWS resources cannot communicate with the internet without IGW.

Important Requirement for Internet Access

To make a subnet public, the following are required:

Requirement	Purpose
Internet Gateway	Internet connectivity
Public Route	Route to IGW
Public IP	Internet-reachable address

All three are necessary.

Meaning:

all internet traffic routes through IGW.
Public Subnet Design

The following subnets were public:

Subnet	CIDR
Public-Subnet-1	10.0.1.0/24
Public-Subnet-2	10.0.2.0/24

These subnets hosted:

ALB
Bastion Host
Web Tier
Common Beginner Mistake

IMPORTANT:
Creating an Internet Gateway alone does NOT automatically provide internet access.

The subnet must also:

use a Route Table with IGW route
have public IP assignment enabled
Security Considerations for Public Resources

Public resources should:

expose only required ports
use Security Groups
avoid unnecessary public access
Example Security Group Rules
Port	Purpose
80	HTTP
443	HTTPS
22	SSH (restricted)
2. NAT Gateway
What is a NAT Gateway

A NAT Gateway allows private subnet resources to access the internet securely without becoming publicly accessible.

Why NAT Gateway Is Required

Private instances often need internet access for:

package installation
software updates
dependency downloads
external API communication

However:

these instances should remain private

NAT Gateway solves this problem.

Key Characteristic of NAT Gateway

NAT Gateway allows:

outbound internet communication

but blocks:

inbound internet initiation

This protects private infrastructure.

Simple Real-World Analogy

Imagine employees inside a secure office.

Employees can:

go outside when needed

But outsiders:

cannot directly enter internal secure areas.

NAT works similarly.

NAT Gateway Placement

A NAT Gateway must be placed in:

a public subnet

because it requires:

internet connectivity through IGW.
NAT Gateway Components
Component	Purpose
Elastic IP	Public internet communication
Public Subnet	Internet reachability
Route Table Association	Traffic routing
NAT Gateway in This Project

The architecture used:

NAT Gateway for private app subnets

This allowed:

secure outbound internet access
package installation
software updates

without exposing app servers publicly.

Practical NAT Usage in This Project

Private app servers used NAT for:

Node.js dependency installation
system updates
backend package downloads
Private Outbound Internet Access
What is Private Outbound Access

Private outbound internet access means:

private instances can access the internet
internet cannot directly initiate communication back

prevents direct exposure
supports secure internet access

This is a standard enterprise architecture pattern.

Common Beginner Mistakes
Mistake	Problem
Placing NAT in private subnet	NAT becomes unreachable
Missing NAT route	No internet access
Public backend servers	Increased attack surface
3. Secure Internet Communication for Private Instances
Why Private Instances Need Internet Access

Private servers still require internet access for:

updates
patches
dependency installation
external API calls
Why They Should Remain Private

Backend systems often contain:

business logic
internal APIs
sensitive communication
database access

Direct internet exposure increases risk.

Enterprise Security Model

## Chapter 5 — Security Groups

Security is one of the most critical aspects of cloud infrastructure design.

In AWS, Security Groups (SGs) act as virtual firewalls that control traffic flowing to and from resources.

Security Groups are fundamental for:

securing EC2 instances
controlling communication
isolating workloads
implementing least privilege access
building enterprise-grade architectures

1. What is a Security Group
Definition

A Security Group (SG) is a virtual firewall attached to AWS resources that controls:

inbound traffic
outbound traffic

Security Groups are commonly attached to:

EC2 instances
Load Balancers
databases
ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces)
Simple Explanation

Security Groups determine:

who can communicate with a resource
which ports are accessible
what type of traffic is allowed
Real-World Analogy

Imagine a secured office building.

The Security Group acts like:

a security guard at the entrance

The guard checks:

who can enter
which rooms can be accessed
what communication is permitted

Similarly:

SGs control network communication.

Why Security Groups Are Important

Without Security Groups:

resources become exposed
unauthorized communication becomes possible
enterprise isolation breaks down

Security Groups provide:

traffic filtering
workload isolation
controlled communication
security segmentation

The project implemented:

multiple SG layers
SG chaining
controlled east-west communication
least privilege traffic flow
High-Level SG Flow

2. Stateful Firewall Concepts
What is a Stateful Firewall

A stateful firewall remembers active connections.

This means:

return traffic is automatically allowed

if the initial request was permitted.

Example

Suppose:

inbound HTTP traffic on port 80 is allowed

When the server responds:

outbound response traffic is automatically allowed

even without explicit outbound rules.

Stateful Communication Flow
Client Request
↓
Security Group
↓
Server Response Automatically Allowed
Why Stateful Firewalls Are Important

Stateful firewalls simplify:

traffic management
return communication
enterprise firewall configuration
Security Groups Are Stateful

AWS Security Groups are:

stateful firewalls

This is one of their most important characteristics.

Difference Between Stateful and Stateless
Feature	Stateful	Stateless
Tracks Connections	Yes	No
Automatic Return Traffic	Yes	No
Simpler Configuration	Yes	No
Example	Security Groups	NACLs
Example in This Project

When:

ALB forwarded requests to Web Tier

the return traffic was automatically allowed because:

Security Groups are stateful.
3. Inbound and Outbound Rules
Inbound Rules

Inbound rules control:

incoming traffic

to a resource.

Example
Port 80 → Allow HTTP traffic

This allows:

users to access web servers.
Outbound Rules

Outbound rules control:

outgoing traffic

from a resource.

Example
Allow traffic to Database Port 3306

This allows:

application servers to communicate with databases.
Security Group Rule Components
Component	Purpose
Protocol	TCP/UDP
Port	Service port
Source/Destination	Traffic origin
Allow Rule	Permitted communication
Common Ports Used in This Project
Port	Purpose
22	SSH
80	HTTP
4000	Backend API
3306	MySQL
Example Security Group Rules
Web Tier SG
Type	Port	Source
HTTP	80	Public ALB SG
SSH	22	Bastion SG
App Tier SG
Type	Port	Source
API	4000	Internal ALB SG
Database SG
Type	Port	Source
MySQL	3306	App Tier SG
Why Restrictive Rules Matter

Restrictive SG rules reduce:

attack surface
unauthorized communication
accidental exposure

This follows:

least privilege security principles
Common Beginner Mistake

IMPORTANT:
Beginners often allow:

0.0.0.0/0

for all ports.

This creates major security risks.

Only required ports should be exposed.

4. SG-to-SG Communication
What is SG-to-SG Communication

Security Groups can reference other Security Groups instead of using IP addresses.

This allows:

secure service-to-service communication
dynamic infrastructure communication
scalable security design
Example

Instead of:

Allow:
10.0.3.10

AWS allows:

Allow:
App-Tier-SG

This is more scalable.

Why SG-to-SG Communication Is Powerful

Benefits:

dynamic scaling support
easier infrastructure management
automatic instance handling
enterprise flexibility
Example Architecture
Web SG
↓
App SG
↓
DB SG

Each layer trusts only specific SGs.

SG Communication in This Project
Public ALB SG

Allowed:

HTTP traffic from internet

Forwarded traffic to:

Web Tier SG
Web Tier SG

Allowed:

traffic only from ALB SG

Forwarded traffic to:

Internal ALB SG
App Tier SG

Allowed:

backend API traffic only from Internal ALB SG
Database SG

Allowed:

MySQL traffic only from App Tier SG
Enterprise Advantage of SG References

Using SG references instead of IPs:

simplifies scaling
supports Auto Scaling
avoids manual IP updates
5. Security Group Chaining
What is Security Group Chaining

Security Group chaining means:

layered SG communication between infrastructure tiers

Each tier communicates only with the next required tier.

Security Chain in This Project
Internet
↓
Public ALB SG
↓
Web Tier SG
↓
Internal ALB SG
↓
App Tier SG
↓
Database SG
Why SG Chaining Is Important

Benefits:

layered security
reduced exposure
controlled communication
enterprise-grade isolation
Example

The database:

trusted only App Tier SG

NOT:

internet traffic
public subnets
external systems

This significantly improved security.

Enterprise Security Principle

This architecture follows:

Zero Trust Networking

Meaning:

every communication must be explicitly allowed.
Benefits of SG Chaining
Benefit	Explanation
Layered Security	Multiple protection layers
Isolation	Controlled traffic flow
Reduced Attack Surface	Minimal exposure
Easier Troubleshooting	Clear communication paths
Common Beginner Mistakes
Mistake	Problem
Using 0.0.0.0/0 everywhere	Excessive exposure
Flat SG design	Poor isolation
Public DB access	Major security risk
6. Layered Security
What is Layered Security

Layered security means:

multiple security controls protect infrastructure

instead of relying on a single protection mechanism.

Enterprise Layered Security Model
Internet
↓
ALB SG
↓
Web SG
↓
Internal ALB SG
↓
App SG
↓
DB SG

Each layer adds protection.

Why Layered Security Is Important

If one layer fails:

other layers still protect infrastructure.
Layered Security Components in This Project
Layer	Protection
Public ALB	Internet filtering
Web Tier SG	Frontend protection
Internal ALB	Internal traffic control
App Tier SG	Backend isolation
DB SG	Database protection
Additional Security Layers Used

The project also used:

private subnets
NAT Gateway
Bastion Host
Route Table isolation
Defense in Depth

This layered model is called:

Defense in Depth

widely used in enterprise cybersecurity.

7. Enterprise Firewall Design
Enterprise Firewall Principles

Enterprise firewall architecture should:

minimize exposure
isolate workloads
allow only required communication
support scalability
follow least privilege
Firewall Design in This Project

The project implemented:

SG segmentation
SG chaining
subnet isolation
private networking
restricted DB access
Communication Model
Source	Destination	Allowed?
Internet	Public ALB	Yes
Internet	App Tier	No
Web Tier	App Tier	Yes
App Tier	Database	Yes
Internet	Database	No
Why This Design Is Strong

This architecture:

prevents direct backend exposure
protects databases
controls internal traffic
reduces attack surface
Real-World Enterprise Example

Banking applications commonly use:

multiple firewall layers
isolated backend systems
restricted database communication

similar to this architecture.

## Chapter 6 — Bastion Host Architecture

In enterprise cloud environments, private infrastructure should never be directly exposed to the internet.

However, administrators still require secure access to:

private EC2 instances
backend servers
databases
internal services

AWS architectures solve this using:

Bastion Hosts

A Bastion Host acts as a secure entry point into private infrastructure.

This chapter explains:

what a Bastion Host is
why it is required
secure administrative access
SSH management strategy
jump server architecture
Bastion implementation from this project

1. What is a Bastion Host
Definition

A Bastion Host is a specially configured EC2 instance placed in a public subnet that provides secure administrative access to private infrastructure.

It acts as:

a controlled entry point
a jump server
a secure SSH gateway
Simple Explanation

Instead of exposing all private servers publicly:

Administrator
↓
Bastion Host
↓
Private Servers

Only the Bastion Host is publicly accessible.

Real-World Analogy

Imagine a secure corporate building.

Visitors:

cannot directly enter restricted internal rooms

Instead:

they first pass through a guarded reception area.

The Bastion Host acts like:

the secure reception gateway

before accessing internal systems.

Why Bastion Hosts Are Important

Without Bastion Hosts:

private servers may require public IPs
SSH ports may be exposed publicly
attack surface increases significantly

Bastion Hosts improve:

security
centralized access control
auditing
private subnet protection
Bastion Host in This Project

The architecture implemented:

Bastion Host in Public Subnet
SSH access to private app servers
controlled administration strategy
2. Why Bastion Hosts Are Required
Problem Without Bastion Hosts

Suppose private app servers need SSH access.

One approach would be:

assigning public IPs to all servers

This creates major security risks.

Risks of Public Backend Access
Risk	Explanation
Increased Attack Surface	More internet-exposed servers
Brute Force Attacks	Public SSH ports exposed
Unauthorized Access	Weak access control
Difficult Auditing	Multiple access points
Bastion Host Solution

Instead of exposing all servers:

Administrator
↓
Bastion Host
↓
Private EC2

Only:

the Bastion Host remains public

All backend systems remain private.

Enterprise Importance

Most enterprise environments:

avoid direct backend exposure
centralize administrative access
isolate private infrastructure

Bastion Hosts support these principles.

3. Secure Administrative Access
Why Secure Administrative Access Matters

Administrators require:

server maintenance
troubleshooting
deployments
log analysis
software installation

However:

unrestricted administrative access creates security risks.
Secure Access Strategy

Bastion Security Group Rules

The Bastion SG allowed:

SSH access only on port 22

Preferably restricted to:

trusted IP ranges
Example Rule
Port	Source
22	Administrator Public IP
Why Restrict SSH Access

Allowing:

0.0.0.0/0

for SSH is dangerous because:

anyone on the internet can attempt access.
Enterprise Best Practice

SSH access should:

use least privilege
restrict IP ranges
use key-based authentication
avoid password login
Secure Access Principles Used
Principle	Purpose
Bastion Access	Centralized administration
Private Backend	No public backend exposure
SG Restrictions	Controlled SSH
Key-Based Access	Secure authentication
4. SSH Management Strategy
What is SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure protocol used for remote administration.

SSH provides:

encrypted communication
secure terminal access
remote server management

Why SSH Keys Are Important

SSH keys are more secure than passwords because:

difficult to brute force
cryptographically secure
widely used in enterprise systems
SSH Key Pair Components
Component	Purpose
Public Key	Stored on server
Private Key	Stored securely by admin
SSH Best Practices
Best Practice	Reason
Use SSH keys	Stronger security
Restrict source IPs	Reduce exposure
Disable password login	Prevent brute force
Use Bastion Host	Centralized access
Avoid public backend access	Secure architecture
Common Beginner Mistakes
Mistake	Risk
Public backend SSH	Increased exposure
Open SSH to internet	Attack risk
Shared SSH keys	Poor accountability

5. Jump Server Architecture
What is a Jump Server

A Jump Server is another term for:

Bastion Host

It acts as:

an intermediary administrative server

between:

administrators
private infrastructure
Jump Server Workflow

reduced attack surface
controlled SSH access
Enterprise Importance of Bastion Hosts

Bastion Hosts are commonly used in:

banking infrastructure
enterprise cloud environments
secure production systems
regulated environments

because they support:

controlled access
centralized administration
secure backend protection

## Chapter 7 — IAM Fundamentals

IAM (Identity and Access Management) is one of the most critical AWS security services.

IAM controls:

who can access AWS
what actions they can perform
which resources they can access

Without IAM:

AWS environments become insecure
unauthorized actions become possible
access control becomes impossible

1. What is IAM
Definition

IAM (Identity and Access Management) is an AWS service used to securely manage:

authentication
authorization
permissions
access control
Simple Explanation

IAM determines:

WHO can access AWS
WHAT they can do
WHICH resources they can use
Real-World Analogy

Imagine a corporate office.

Different employees receive different access:

managers
HR
finance
engineers

Not everyone can access every department.

IAM works similarly in AWS.

IAM Architecture

AWS Resource Access
Why IAM Is Important

IAM helps:

secure AWS environments
prevent unauthorized access
implement least privilege
control permissions centrally
IAM in This Project

The project implemented:

IAM user creation
AdministratorAccess permissions
secure AWS management access
2. IAM Users
What is an IAM User

An IAM User represents:

an individual identity inside AWS

Each user can have:

username
password
access keys
permissions
Example IAM Users
User	Purpose
Admin User	Full AWS management
Developer User	Limited development access
ReadOnly User	Monitoring access
IAM User in This Project

The project created:

IAM administrative user

Used for:

AWS console access
infrastructure deployment
service management
Why IAM Users Are Important

Using IAM users is safer than:

using root account regularly
Root Account Risk

The AWS root account:

has unrestricted permissions

Using it daily is dangerous.

Enterprise Best Practice

Use:

IAM users
IAM roles

instead of:

root account
3. IAM Groups
What is an IAM Group

An IAM Group is a collection of IAM users.

Permissions can be assigned to groups instead of individual users.

Example
Developers Group
↓
EC2 Access

All developers inherit:

the same permissions
Benefits of IAM Groups
Benefit	Explanation
Easier Management	Centralized permissions
Consistency	Standardized access
Scalability	Manage multiple users easily
Enterprise Example

Organizations commonly create:

DevOps groups
Security groups
ReadOnly groups
Billing groups
4. IAM Policies
What is an IAM Policy

An IAM Policy defines:

allowed actions
denied actions
resource permissions

Policies are written in:

JSON format
Example Policy Logic
Allow:
Start EC2 Instances
Policy Types
Policy Type	Purpose
AWS Managed Policy	AWS-provided
Customer Managed Policy	Custom organization policy
Inline Policy	Directly attached policy
AdministratorAccess Policy

This project used:

AdministratorAccess

This provides:

full AWS permissions
Why Admin Access Was Used

The project required:

VPC creation
EC2 management
Route 53 configuration
ALB setup
IAM management

Administrative permissions simplified learning and deployment.

Enterprise Warning

IMPORTANT:
Production environments should avoid unnecessary full administrative access.

5. Administrative Access
What is Administrative Access

Administrative access allows:

full management of AWS services

Examples:

create/delete resources
modify infrastructure
manage IAM
Risks of Full Admin Access
Risk	Explanation
Accidental Deletion	Critical infrastructure removal
Security Risk	Full account compromise
Excessive Permissions	Violates least privilege
Enterprise Best Practice

Use:

role-based permissions
limited access
least privilege policies

instead of:

unrestricted admin access
6. Least Privilege Principle
What is Least Privilege

Least privilege means:

granting only the permissions required

and nothing more.

Example

A developer requiring:

EC2 restart access

should NOT receive:

billing access
IAM management access
Why Least Privilege Is Important

Benefits:

reduced security risk
minimized accidental actions
stronger access control
Least Privilege in Enterprise Security

Modern enterprises strongly enforce:

least privilege access models
7. MFA Concepts
What is MFA

MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) adds an additional security layer during login.

Users provide:

password
secondary verification

Example:

mobile authenticator code
MFA Authentication Flow
Username + Password
↓
MFA Verification
↓
AWS Access Granted
Why MFA Is Important

Even if passwords are compromised:

attackers still cannot log in easily
Enterprise Importance of MFA

MFA is critical for:

administrators
privileged users
production environments
AWS MFA Methods
Method	Example
Virtual MFA	Google Authenticator
Hardware MFA	Physical security key

8. IAM Best Practices
Enterprise IAM Best Practices
Best Practice	Reason
Avoid Root Account Usage	Reduce risk
Enable MFA	Stronger authentication
Use Least Privilege	Minimize permissions
Use IAM Groups	Easier management
Rotate Credentials	Improve security
Use Roles When Possible	Temporary secure access

Common Beginner Mistakes
Mistake	Risk
Using Root Account Daily	High security risk
No MFA	Account compromise
Full Admin for Everyone	Excessive permissions
Shared Credentials	Poor accountability

## Practical Implementation — IAM Configuration

This section explains the practical IAM implementation performed during the project.

The IAM setup was used to:

* securely manage AWS infrastructure
* avoid daily usage of the root account
* perform VPC, EC2, Route 53, ALB, and networking configurations

The implementation included:

* IAM user creation
* assigning administrative permissions
* configuring AWS console access
* using IAM credentials for infrastructure management

---

### 1. Creating an IAM User

---

Objective

Create a dedicated IAM user for AWS infrastructure management instead of using the root account.

---

Why This Was Done

Using the root account for daily operations is not recommended because:

* it has unrestricted access
* accidental actions can affect the entire AWS account
* it increases security risks

Instead:

* a separate IAM user was created.

---

| Console Access | Enabled         |
| Password Type  | Custom Password |

---

Step 4 — Set Password

Configured:

* secure password for console login

Optional:

* require password reset during first login

---

2. Assigning AdministratorAccess Policy

---

Objective

Provide full AWS permissions required for:

* VPC setup
* EC2 management
* Route 53 configuration
* Load Balancer setup
* networking configuration
* IAM management

---

Policy Used

```text
AdministratorAccess
```

---

Why This Policy Was Used

The project involved:

* multiple AWS services
* networking configuration
* security setup
* infrastructure deployment

Administrative access simplified:

* learning
* deployment
* experimentation

---

Steps Performed

---

Step 1 — Open Permission Assignment

During user creation:

```text
Set Permissions
↓
Attach Policies Directly
```

---

Step 2 — Search for Policy

Searched for:

```text
AdministratorAccess
```

---

Step 3 — Attach Policy

Selected:

```text
AdministratorAccess
```

and attached it to the IAM user.

---

Result

The IAM user received:

* full AWS management permissions

including:

* EC2
* VPC
* Route 53
* Load Balancers
* IAM
* Auto Scaling
* Security Groups

---

Important Security Note

> IMPORTANT:
> Full administrative access is acceptable for learning environments,
> but production environments should follow least privilege principles.

---

3. IAM User Login Process

---

Objective

Use IAM credentials instead of the root account.

---

Steps Performed

---

Step 1 — Retrieve IAM Login URL

AWS generated an IAM login URL similar to:

```text
https://account-id.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
```

---

Step 2 — Login Using IAM Credentials

Used:

* IAM username
* IAM password

instead of:

* root email credentials

---

Benefit

This improved:

* account security
* access management
* operational separation

---

4. Using IAM Credentials for Infrastructure Management

---

Objective

Use IAM user permissions to manage AWS infrastructure securely.

---
